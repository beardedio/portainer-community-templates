# Portainer Community Templates

This repository hosts the community added templates ('Apps Templates') definitions for portainer.

This includes the [official templates](https://github.com/portainer/templates), the [LinuxServer.io templates](https://www.linuxserver.io/) and [templates](templates) provided by this repo.

## How to use
In your portainer installation, under settings. Enable `Use custom templates` and input this url `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beardedio/portainer-community-templates/master/templates.json` and save.
Once this is done you can go to `App Templates` and refresh the list. It should now show many more templates to choose from!
